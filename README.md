# Hey, I'm [Adam](https://adamcoscia.com)! 👋 

💻 I research and build novel visual analytics **interfaces** that empower people to discover rich insights in complex **data** for making smarter, more informed **decisions**. My current focus is on leveraging and evaluating **LLMs** in complex workflows.

⭐ My work has helped analysts, engineers, scientists, and everyday users:
- have smarter, goal-informed conversations with LLMs 🤖
- [use AI to summarize & visualize intelligence data](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/vispile/) 🕵️
- [measure the trustworthiness of LLMs in education](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/iscore/) 🎓
- [conduct scientific fieldwork during deep ocean expeditions](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/deepsee/) 🌊
- [evaluate the embedded world knowledge of LLMs](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/knowledgevis/) 🗺️
- [develop scientist-guided spacecraft autonomy](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/rerank/) 🚀
- [mitigate cognitive biases during data analysis](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/lumos/) 📊

🌱 I'm currently a **Human-Centered Computing PhD student** at Georgia Tech. I work with [Alex Endert](https://va.gatech.edu/endert/) as a member of the [Visual Analytics Lab](https://gtvalab.github.io/)

💞️ I've collaborated with incredible designers, researchers, engineers, and scientists at the National Security Agency (NSA), NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Adobe Research, Caltech, Vanderbilt, Georgia State, Tufts, Emory, ArtCenter, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI).
