# Hey, I'm [Adam](https://adamcoscia.com)! 👋 

💻 I research how to build new visual analytics **interfaces** that empower people to discover rich **insights** in complex data and make smarter, more data-driven **decisions**. My current focus is on leveraging and evaluating **AI** in complex data analysis workflows.

⭐ My work has helped analysts, engineers, scientists, and everyday users:
- [have smarter, goal-informed conversations with LLMs](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/ongoal/) 🤖
- [leverage AI to summarize & visualize sets of documents](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/vispile/) 🕵️
- [measure the trustworthiness of LLMs in education](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/iscore/) 🎓
- [conduct scientific fieldwork during deep ocean expeditions](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/deepsee/) 🌊
- [evaluate the embedded world knowledge of LLMs](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/knowledgevis/) 🗺️
- [develop scientist-guided spacecraft autonomy](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/rerank/) 🚀
- [mitigate cognitive biases during data analysis](https://adamcoscia.com/papers/lumos/) 📊

🌱 I'm currently a **Human-Centered Computing PhD student** at Georgia Tech. I work with [Alex Endert](https://va.gatech.edu/endert/) as a member of the [Visual Analytics Lab](https://gtvalab.github.io/)

💞️ I've collaborated with incredible designers, researchers, engineers, and scientists at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, National Security Agency (NSA), Adobe Research, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Caltech, Vanderbilt, Georgia State, Tufts, Emory, ArtCenter College of Design, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI).
