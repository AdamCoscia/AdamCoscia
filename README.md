# Hey, I'm [Adam](https://adamcoscia.com)! 👋 

💻 I design and develop visual analytics systems that help people understand complex data, reduce risks, and make decisions. My tools have been used by researchers, scientists, engineers and everyday users for explaining and interpreting large language models (LLMs) 🤖, enabling trustworthy AI in education ✏️, guiding deep ocean expeditions 🌊 and enabling scientist-guided spacecraft autonomy 🚀

🌱 I'm currently a Human-Centered Computing PhD student at Georgia Tech. I work with [Alex Endert](https://va.gatech.edu/endert/) as a member of the [Visual Analytics Lab](https://gtvalab.github.io/).

💞️ I've collaborated with incredible designers, engineers, scientists, and researchers at Adobe Research, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Caltech, Vanderbilt, Georgia State, Tufts, Emory, ArtCenter, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI).
