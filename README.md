# Hey, I'm [Adam](https://adamcoscia.com)! 👋 

💻 I research and build novel visual analytics **interfaces** that empower people to discover rich insights in complex **data** for making smarter, more informed **decisions**. My current focus is on leveraging and evaluating **LLMs** in complex workflows.

⭐ My work has helped analysts, engineers, scientists, and everyday users:
- have smarter, goal-informed conversations with LLMs 🤖
- measure the trustworthiness of LLMs in education 🎓
- use AI to summarize & visualize intelligence data 🕵️
- develop scientist-guided spacecraft autonomy 🚀
- conduct scientific fieldwork during deep ocean expeditions 🌊
- mitigate cognitive biases during data analysis 📊

🌱 I'm currently a **Human-Centered Computing PhD student** at Georgia Tech. I work with [Alex Endert](https://va.gatech.edu/endert/) as a member of the [Visual Analytics Lab](https://gtvalab.github.io/)

💞️ I've collaborated with incredible designers, researchers, engineers, and scientists at Adobe Research, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Caltech, Vanderbilt, Georgia State, Tufts, Emory, ArtCenter, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI)
