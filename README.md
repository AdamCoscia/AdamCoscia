# About Me

### Hey, I'm [Adam](https://adamcoscia.github.io/)!👋 

👀 I make complex data simple by researching and building novel visual analytics tools. My work helps scientists, researchers and engineers make decisions, understand how AI works, and [mitigate cognitive bias](https://github.com/lumos-vis).

🌱 I'm currently a Human-Centered Computing PhD student at Georgia Tech. I work with [Alex Endert](https://va.gatech.edu/endert/) as a member of the [Visual Analytics Lab](https://gtvalab.github.io/).

💞️ I've collaborated with incredible designers, engineers, and scientists at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech, Emory, and Tufts universities.
